# BinanceTradeBot
A nice trading bot that trades based on the Hull moving average on Binance.

This trading bot uses my favorite indicator, the Hull Moving average.

After creating your own API key on Binance, write it in the required field. 

In the "symbol" section, write the parity you want to trade. 

You can write the amount you want to trade in the amount field. 

If there is not enough money in your account, the bot will not trade, but will continue to work. 

It works on a 4-hour chart, you can adjust it according to you.
